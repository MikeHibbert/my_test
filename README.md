# AngryBurds
This is the base class for my Burd class!

Fork my code then reate a new branch and call it [your name separated by '-'s.

Pick a Burd you can derive from the Burd class and add a call and a wing sound and and then commit it back to git 

Next create a pull request to have it sent back to my main copy!
